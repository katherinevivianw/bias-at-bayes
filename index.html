                                The technology industry's workforce diversity gap is a long-time problem that many have attempted to combat. Less than 
                                a quarter of employees in computing and engineering are women; furthermore, only 5% of engineering jobs are comprised 
                                of Black workers, while 9% of engineering are Hispanic (Fry 2021). <br>
                                <br>
                                This project is inspired by a discussion that I had in my seminar course <i>FEMGEN 147: Feminism and Technology</i>,
                                which addressed the following issue. Current solutions for increasing diversity in the tech industry workforce — such as 
                                the annual Grace Hopper Conference and diversity programs (e.g. Microsoft Explore and Meta University) — are often hyper-fixated 
                                on increasing the pipeline of initially helping marginalized individuals land roles. <br>
                                <br>
                                However, <u><b>hiring is just one part of the equation</b></u>. Largely neglected when evaluating the diversity gap problem is the 
                                retention of diverse talent — and what factors might influence an underrepresented employee's decision to leave a company. <br>

                            <p class="about-description"> 
                                The goal of <i>Keeping Bias at Bay(es)</i> is to make a user-friendly, accessible tool that utilizes machine learning to demonstrate
                                what factors influence an employee's attrition status, and how attrition status can impact other factors. <br>
                                <br>
                                The way it works is simple. Behind the scenes, a Naive Bayes machine learning algorithm is trained on a company's Human Resources dataset. 
                                The user can input what they want to get the probability of, along with what factors they want to condition on in the UI. Finally, the Naive Bayes
                                algorithm runs with these inputs and outputs the final probability for the user to view. <br>
                                <br>
                                Since company HR datasets are often not published to the general public, we see this tool being internally used by tech companies to evaluate 
                                whether the problem of not retaining diverse talent is evident, and what factors they can consider in order to address the issue. <br>
